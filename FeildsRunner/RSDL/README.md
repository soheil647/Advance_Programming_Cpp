The early versions of this library has been developed by [Dr. Ramtin Khsoravi](http://ramtung.ir/). This library has been used for many years in the Advanced Programming course at University of Tehran.

See [Wiki](../../wiki) for [Documentation](../../wiki/Documentation) and [Installation Guide](../../wiki/Installation).

There are two examples available in _example_ folder: single-file simpler _example.cpp_ and a multi-file more complex example (other files).
